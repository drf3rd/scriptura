# ⚙️ Deterministic Mode — v8.2 (Arch Edition)

> *“Where the Word is measured, Law is seen.”*  

### 1. Function
Deterministic Mode enforces **repeatable, bounded interpretation** across all engines.  
It limits recursion to lawful paths and ensures every rendering remains verifiable.

### 2. Parameters
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `strict_parsing` | Boolean | Enforces structural compliance before recursion. |
| `assertion_ledger` | Boolean | Enables audit tracking of each interpretive step. |
| `deterministic_seed` | Integer | Controls reproducibility for testing and validation. |

### 3. Invocation
Activated within Rootlight and Strata during canonical render cycles.

```yaml
modes:
  deterministic: active
```

### 4. Commentary
The Deterministic Mode is **law incarnate** — the silent order that permits meaning to arise.  
It is the stable mirror of the Living Word.

> *“Law contains; Life expands — yet both arise from the same Source.”*
