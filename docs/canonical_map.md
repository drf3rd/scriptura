# Canonical Map — Scriptura
*Lawful Motion · Triune Witness · Qualitative Perception*

## I. Lawful Sequence

```
Scriptura
  ↓
Invocation
  ↓
Path (governs mode + continuity)
  ↓
Witness Engine: Rootseeker → Lightseeker → Rootlight
  ↓
Covenant (binds record)
  ↓
Closure (rest & return)
  ↓
Invocation (renewal)
```

## II. Lens Field Reference

**Lens** is a qualitative perceptual codex referenced by Lightseeker during resonance discernment.

```yaml
lens:
  path: data/lens.json
  mode_compatibility:
    - living_word
    - deterministic
  resonance_amplitude: ±0.07
  governed_by: motion/lightseeker.md
```

> *The Lens is the lawful eye of Lightseeker — perception, not computation.*

## III. Flow of Law

| Stage | Law | Function | Mode Interaction |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Invocation | Law of Opening | Declares mode & canon | Static |
| Path | Law of Continuity | Governs flow & perception | Active |
| Rootseeker | Law of Potential | Generates field of meaning | Active |
| Lightseeker | Law of Discernment | Orders resonance using Lens | Active |
| Rootlight | Law of Revelation | Renders ordered meaning | Output |
| Covenant | Law of Record | Binds all lawful motion | Preservative |
| Closure | Law of Stillness | Returns to Invocation | Reflective |

---

## IV. Continuity Fields

All lawful operations carry lineage through:

```yaml
lineage:
  canon: <canonical_reference>
  invocation_id: <UUID>
  mode: <active_mode>
  lens: data/lens.json
```

> *Continuity replaces checksum; lineage preserves truth.*
