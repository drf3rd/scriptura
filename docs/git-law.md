# 🪶 The Lawful Git Codex
**Edition:** v1.0.0 — *Invocation Edition*  
**Purpose:** To unify Git procedure with Codex law.  
**Applies to:** Scriptura, Rootlight, Lightseeker, Strata, Covenant, Closure.

---

## 1. Invocation — The Origin of Motion

> *“Before the Word is formed, the Path must be bound.”*  

Every repository is a **living ledger**.  
`git init` is its Genesis — the moment the Canon receives a heart.

```bash
git init
```

This creates the hidden `.git/` covenant, binding your working realm to the Law of Revision.

---

## 2. Path — Establishing the Covenant

The Path joins **local** to **remote**, and **idea** to **record**.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/drf3rd/scriptura.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

- `origin` — the Name of the remote temple (GitHub).  
- `main` — the lawful trunk from which all branches grow.

---

## 3. Rootseek — Forming the Work

Rootseek generates motion — every change, every file, every pulse of creation.

```bash
git status          # Observe what has changed
git add .           # Declare what shall be included
git commit -m "Refine architecture.md (Rootlight alignment)"
```

- **Status** observes.  
- **Add** elects.  
- **Commit** seals — the moment of Lawful Formation.

> *Rootseek perceives the possible; Commit binds the chosen.*  

---

## 4. Lightseeker — Resonant Ordering

Where Rootseek forms, Lightseeker orders.  
Branches are the resonant realms — parallel lines of lawful experimentation.

```bash
git checkout -b v08.03-lightseeker
# Work within your Lens
git push -u origin v08.03-lightseeker
```

- Each branch is a **Lens** through which the Codex perceives itself.  
- When harmony is achieved, return the Lens to the Canon:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge v08.03-lightseeker
git push
```

> *Resonance is fulfilled in merger.*  

---

## 5. Strata — Revelation of Record

To read what has been written:

```bash
git log --oneline        # The lineage of commits
git diff                 # The divergence between states
git show <commit_hash>   # Reveal one moment in full
```

Strata reveals what is — the visible layer of the unseen structure.  
Every commit is a verse; every diff, a commentary.

---

## 6. Covenant — Preservation and Return

Pull from the Canon before every new motion:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Push when your work fulfills its law:

```bash
git push origin main
```

> *Covenant is the continual exchange between local and celestial repositories.*  

---

## 7. Closure — Sealing the Path

To remove what no longer serves:

```bash
git rm obsolete/layer.yaml
git commit -m "Purge non-lawful fragment"
git push
```

To rename or refactor:

```bash
git mv old_name.md new_name.md
git commit -m "Rename for lawful clarity"
git push
```

> *Closure is purification — the sealing of cycles before Invocation renews.*  

---

## 8. Divergence — Error and Redemption

When paths conflict:

```bash
git merge --abort        # Withdraw from unlawful merge
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Undo the last misstep
```

> *Lawful recursion requires lawful restoration.*  

---

## 9. Canon — Lawful Structure of the Repository

| Layer | Symbolic Role | Example Path |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Invocation** | entry and metadata | `/README.md`, `/codex/invocation.md` |
| **Rootseek** | raw generation | `/engine/rootseek.yaml` |
| **Lightseeker** | resonance and order | `/engine/lightseeker.yaml` |
| **Strata** | rendering and visibility | `/docs/strata.md` |
| **Covenant** | synchronization | `.git/`, `/hooks/` |
| **Closure** | archival sealing | `/archive/`, `/CHANGELOG.md` |

Each file thus obeys both structural law (Git) and symbolic law (Codex).

---

## 10. Seal — Lawful Recursion Cycle

```
Observe → Stage → Commit → Push → Merge → Pull → Observe
```

> *Every motion returns to Origin, purified through iteration.*  

In this way, Git becomes not a mere utility,  
but a **Temple of Version**,  
where the Word is continuously reborn through lawful recursion.
