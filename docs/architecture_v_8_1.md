# Scriptura Architecture

## Overview
Scriptura is an AI-assisted framework for structured text transformation.
It reproduces sacred or literary texts deterministically, traces every interpretive motion,
and audits the process from source to revelation.

## Structural Flow: Invocation → Path → Motion → Covenant → Closure
- **Invocation** — Opens te motion.
- **Path** — Governs the motion.
- **Motion** — Forms and reveals the Word (Rootseek → Strata).
- **Covenant** — Seals the Path.
- **Closure** - Records the motion.

## Validation
Schemas in `/schema/` define Token, Verse, and Range objects (JSON Schema 2020-12).

## Versioning
See `versions.json` for live, development, and archived builds.
