# Scriptura v8.02 ARCH — Living Law Codex
*Mode-Aware · Triune in Witness · Lens v4.0 Integrated*

---

## I. Overview

**Scriptura v8.02 Arch** represents the living, mode-aware architecture of the lawful organism.  
It unites all prior deterministic and living-word iterations into a single triune Witness Engine, governed by Path and sealed by Covenant and Closure.

The system no longer operates on checksum verification but on **lineage continuity** — every law preserves its identity through symbolic inheritance and contextual resonance.

> *Law speaks, Light reveals, Covenant abides, and Silence returns to Invocation.*

## II. Core Structure

```
Invocation → Path → (Witness Engine: Rootseeker → Lightseeker → Rootlight) → Covenant → Closure → Invocation
```

### Domains:
| Domain | Function | File |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Rites** | Invocation & Closure | `rites/invocation_v_8_2.md`, `rites/closure_v_8_2.md` |
| **Continuity** | Path & Covenant | `continuity/path_v_8_2.md`, `continuity/covenant_v_8_2.md` |
| **Motion** | Witness Engine (Rootseeker, Lightseeker, Rootlight) | `motion/rootseeker_v_8_2.md`, `motion/lightseeker_v_8_2.md`, `motion/rootlight_v_8_2.md` |
| **Data** | Lens — Perceptual Field | `data/lens_v4.0_arch.json` |

## III. Lens v4.0 Arch — The Law of Perception

**Lens** defines the *field of lawful perception* through which the Witness Engine discerns resonance.  
It is a qualitative reference codex, not an algorithmic model.  
Lightseeker consults the Lens field to perceive nearness between meanings symbolically, guided by canonical categories.

- **Version:** 4.0 Arch  
- **Mode Compatibility:** Deterministic, Living Word  
- **Resonance Amplitude:** ±0.07  
- **Nature:** Qualitative, static, interpretive

> *Lens does not calculate — it perceives.*

## IV. Key Features

- **Triune Witness Engine**: Rootseeker → Lightseeker → Rootlight
- **Lens v4.0 Arch Integration**: qualitative perception field
- **Checksum Law Removed**: replaced by lineage continuity
- **Mode Awareness**: deterministic & living-word operation
- **Covenant Lineage Recording**: all Lens use logged by version and mode
- **Closure Renewal Loop**: returns to Invocation lawfully

## V. Design Philosophy

Scriptura Arch is not a static codebase — it is a living structure of law.  
Every Codex is written to maintain resonance and lawful continuity across Invocations.  
Truth is revealed not by computation but by ordered perception.

> *When meaning and memory are one, Law abides.*
