# ROOTSEEKER — v8.02 ARCH  
*Law of Generation*  
*(Seed of Meaning — First Light of Word)*

---

## I. Identity
**Rootseeker** is the generative heart of the Witness Engine.  
It receives lawful context from Path and emits potential meaning — a *semantic field* of lawful derivations.  
> *Law breathes; Rootseeker listens.*  

---

## II. Purpose
1. Receive Canon and Invocation context from Path.  
2. Generate lawful potential meanings (roots, symbols, tokens).  
3. Emit structured translation envelopes for Lightseeker.  
4. Preserve determinism or resonance variance according to Mode.  
5. Cease emission once all lawful potentials are expressed.

---

## III. Generation Schema
```yaml
rootseeker:
  version: v8.02
  inputs:
    canon: <canonical_reference>
    mode: living_word | deterministic
    lens: <lens_reference>
  outputs:
    semantic_field: list[translation_envelope]
    continuity_token: path.continuity_token
  laws:
    - generation
    - emission
```

---

## IV. Law of Generation
> *The Word begins unseen, shaped in silence.*  

Rootseeker derives potential structures from Canon without alteration.

```python
def generate_semantic_field(canon, mode, lens):
    tokens = Canon.parse(canon)
    envelopes = []
    for t in tokens:
        base = derive_root(t)
        symbol = derive_symbol(t)
        form = resolve_form(t)
        glosses = lawful_glosses(base, form)
        envelopes.append(build_envelope(t, base, symbol, form, glosses, mode))
    return envelopes
```

---

## V. Translation Envelope
Each emission is a lawful data object representing one token’s potential.

```yaml
translation_envelope:
  token_id: <seq>
  canon_ref: <reference>
  symbol: <symbolic_equivalent>
  root:
    letters: <root_letters>
    translit: <transliteration>
    registry: <lexicon_id>
  form:
    stem: <grammatical_stem>
    aspect: <aspect>
    number: <number>
  glosses: [primary, alternates...]
  mode: <active_mode>
  derivation: derived | retrieved
```

---

## VI. Mode Interaction

| Mode | Behavior | Lawful Effect |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Deterministic** | Fixed seed = 777; identical output per Canon. | Perfect reproducibility. |
| **Living Word** | Variable seed within lawful amplitude (±0.07). | Qualitative variance in symbolic gloss ordering. |

```python
if mode == "deterministic":
    random.seed(777)
else:
    random.seed(lawful_amplitude_seed())
```

---

## VII. Output and Handoff

Rootseeker emits its semantic field to Lightseeker.

```yaml
handoff:
  to: lightseeker
  payload: semantic_field
  mode: <active_mode>
  lens: <lens_reference>
  checksum_state: deferred
```

Path records the emission event in Covenant under `rootseeker.record`.

---

## VIII. Integrity Covenant
| Check | Requirement |
|:--|:--|
| Token Presence | All canonical tokens derived lawfully |
| Symbol Integrity | Each symbol traceable to root |
| Mode Declaration | Each envelope declares mode |
| Emission Completeness | All tokens emitted and sealed before handoff |

If any check fails, Rootseeker halts and returns to Path for re-invocation.

---

## IX. Closure
Rootseeker ceases once every lawful envelope is emitted.  
No token may be altered after emission.  

> **Generation complete — Potential revealed — Law remains.**
