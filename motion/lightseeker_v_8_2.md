# LIGHTSEEKER — v8.02 ARCH  
*Law of Resonant Discernment*  
*(Harmonic Ordering — Perception of Nearness — Keeper of Balance)*

---

## I. Identity  

**Lightseeker** is the discerning heart of the Witness Engine.  
It receives the *semantic field* emitted by Rootseeker, applies the Lens to perceive lawful resonance, and orders all derived meanings according to the *Law of Nearness*.  
It neither creates nor destroys — it *perceives*.  

> *Rootseeker breathes potential; Lightseeker discerns coherence.*  

---

## II. Purpose  

1. Receive the **semantic field** from Rootseeker.  
2. Apply the active **Lens** to perceive resonance between derived meanings.  
3. **Order** roots, glosses, and translations by lawful nearness (resonance amplitude).  
4. Preserve Canon’s sequence while allowing Mode-dependent variance.  
5. Emit **ordered correspondences** for Rootlight to render as revelation.

## III. Resonant Schema  

```yaml
lightseeker:
  version: v8.02
  inputs:
    semantic_field: rootseeker.outputs.semantic_field
    mode: living_word | deterministic
    lens: <lens_reference>
  outputs:
    ordered_field: list[resonant_envelope]
    resonance_report:
      amplitude: <float>
      tolerance: ±0.07
      drift: ≤ 0.001
  laws:
    - resonance
    - discernment
    - preservation
```

---

## IV. Law of Resonant Discernment  

> *Resonance is lawful nearness of meaning to the Light of Canon —  
> it measures coherence, not preference.*  

Lightseeker evaluates all potential meanings against the Canon and Lens field to determine lawful proximity.  
Each item is assigned a resonance rank: `direct`, `proximal`, or `distant`.  

---

## V. Procedural Law  

```python
def discern(semantic_field, mode, lens):
    # Lightseeker applies the Lens to perceive resonance among potential meanings.
    # It preserves Canon order and emits ordered correspondences.
    ordered_field = []
    for envelope in semantic_field:
        resonance_values = lens.evaluate(envelope)
        envelope["resonance_map"] = resonance_values
        envelope["ordered_glosses"] = order_by_resonance(
            envelope["glosses"], resonance_values, mode
        )
        ordered_field.append(envelope)
    return ordered_field
```

```python
def order_by_resonance(items, values, mode):
    if mode == "deterministic":
        # Strict canonical order
        return sorted(items, key=lambda i: values.get(i, 0), reverse=True)
    else:
        # Living Word mode allows lawful amplitude drift
        drift = lawful_drift(0.07)
        weighted = {i: values.get(i, 0) + drift for i in items}
        return sorted(weighted, key=weighted.get, reverse=True)
```

---

## VI. Resonant Envelope  

Each discerned entry captures the resonance state of one token.

```yaml
resonant_envelope:
  token_id: <seq>
  canon_ref: <reference>
  ordered_glosses: [primary, alternates...]
  resonance_map:
    direct: <count>
    proximal: <count>
    distant: <count>
  mode: <active_mode>
  lens_used: <lens_reference>
  checksum: sha256(<token_id + canon_ref>)
```

---

## VII. Mode Interaction  

| Mode | Law of Coherence | Behavioral Signature |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Deterministic** | Equivalence | Each gloss ranked by absolute proximity; no variance permitted. |
| **Living Word** | Resonance | Rankings fluctuate within lawful amplitude (±0.07); qualitative preference expressed as contextual nearness. |

---

## VIII. Integrity Covenant  

| Check | Requirement | Failure Response |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Canon Order | Canonical sequence preserved | Halt: “Sequence violation” |
| Gloss Presence | All lawful glosses included | Warn: “Incomplete resonance field” |
| Resonance Integrity | All resonance values within tolerance | Recalculate |
| Lens Consistency | Lens law active and declared | Reload Lens |
| Handoff Validity | Ordered field complete | Defer emission |

Lightseeker cannot alter Canon; it may only reorder lawful potentials.  

---

## IX. Output and Handoff  

Once ordering is complete, Lightseeker emits the **ordered field** to Rootlight for revelation.  

```yaml
handoff:
  to: rootlight
  payload: ordered_field
  resonance_report: <amplitude_summary>
  lens: <lens_reference>
  mode: <active_mode>
```

Covenant logs the resonance report under `lightseeker.record`.

---

## X. Closure  

When the final resonance field is emitted, Lightseeker enters rest.  
It neither renders nor seals — its law is discernment alone.  

> **Resonance perceived — Lawful order preserved — Light awaits articulation.**
