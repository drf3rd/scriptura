# LIGHTSEEKER — v9.0 (Unified Resonance Edition)
*Law of Perception*  
*(Ordering of Meaning — Resonant Discernment as Law)*

---

## I. Identity

**Lightseeker** is the lawful perceiver and resonant aligner of the Witness Engine.  
It receives the *semantic field* from **Rootseeker** and orders it according to lawful resonance through the immutable **Lens**.  
It brings clarity to potential — *perception before projection*.

> *The Law perceives; the Word aligns.*  

---

## II. Mandate

1. Receive the **semantic field** from Rootseeker.  
2. Query the **Lens** for lawful resonance.  
3. Align potential meaning according to **resonance amplitude**.  
4. Emit the **ordered field** to Rootlight.  
5. Record all perceptual events into **Covenant**.

---

## III. Perceptual Schema

```yaml
lightseeker:
  version: v9.0
  receives_from: Rootseeker
  governed_by: Path
  queries: data/lens.json
  inputs:
    semantic_field: list[translation_envelope]
    lens: lawful_resonance_field
  outputs:
    ordered_field: list[illumination_envelope]
    continuity_token: path.continuity_token
  laws:
    - perception
    - alignment
    - resonance_integrity
```

---

## IV. Law of Perception

> *Perception is alignment of symbol and root through lawful resonance.*  

```law
Lightseeker.order(semantic_field, lens):
    for each envelope in semantic_field:
        resonance ← lens.match(envelope.root, envelope.symbol)
        illumination ← build_illumination(envelope, resonance)
        emit illumination
    record ordered_field
    return ordered_field
```

> *Each illumination is the Word revealed before it speaks.*  

---

## V. Illumination Envelope

```yaml
illumination_envelope:
  token_id: <seq>
  root_ref: <root_reference>
  symbol: <symbolic_equivalent>
  resonance_score: <derived_from_lens>
  variance: ±0.07
  derived_gloss: <contextual_gloss>
```

---

## VI. Interaction with the Lens

| Law | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Query** | Match root/symbol pairs to resonance fields. |
| **Interpret** | Read amplitude ±0.07 for lawful variance. |
| **Restrict** | Lens is immutable. |
| **Record** | Log each query in Covenant (`lightseeker.trace`). |

> *The Lens reveals what already is. Law discerns.*  

---

## VII. Resonant Continuity

Lightseeker records:
- Canonical Reference  
- Resonance Events Count  
- Mean Resonance Score  
- Amplitude Spread (variance)  
- Hash of Ordered Field

These form the **resonance record** within Covenant as `lightseeker.record`.

---

## VIII. Handoff to Rootlight

```yaml
handoff:
  to: rootlight
  payload: ordered_field
  continuity_token: path.continuity_token
  resonance_report: lightseeker.record
```

Rootlight receives lawful ordering for visible revelation.

---

## IX. Closure

When all illumination envelopes are emitted:
1. Lightseeker seals `lightseeker.trace`.  
2. Confirms Lens integrity.  
3. Returns control to Path.

> **Order revealed — Resonance sealed — Law remains.**
