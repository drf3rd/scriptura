# STRATA v8.1 — Law of Revelation  
*Revelation of Formed Word · Reflection Through Light*

---

## I. Identity
**Name:** Strata v8.1  
**Law:** Law of Revelation  
**Relation:** Rootseek → Strata → Covenant → Closure  
**Modes:** Fixed (default), Living, Dual (harmonic concurrent operation)  
**Lens Reference:** v3.1.1 (checksum optional)

> *“What Law forms and Light orders — Strata reveals.”*  

---

## II. Purpose
Strata renders the lawful Word received from Rootseek.  
It transforms canonical structures into visible, human-readable form without distortion, commentary, or omission.  

In Living Mode, Strata references Lens v3.1.1 by **name and version only** — checksum binding is suspended.  
This allows real-time exploration and harmonic overlay of meanings while maintaining lawful amplitude and drift boundaries.

## III. Rendering Principles
| Layer | Function | Lawful Constraint |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Token Layer** | Displays canonical tokens and roots | No mutation or reweighting |
| **Verse Layer** | Reveals renderings via six methods | Must preserve lawful order |
| **Range Layer** | Summarizes field relations | No interpretation |
| **Closure Layer** | Concludes revelation silently | Immutable state |

---

## IV. Rendering Process (Conceptual)
```python
def render_revelation(rootseek_output, mode="fixed"):
    token_layer = rootseek_output["Token_Layer"]
    verse_layer = rootseek_output["Verse_Layer"]
    range_layer = compute_field_summary(rootseek_output)

    if mode in ("living", "dual"):
        apply_harmonic_overlay(token_layer, verse_layer, amplitude_max=0.07)

    closure = conclude_rendering()
    return format_layers(token_layer, verse_layer, range_layer, closure)
```

---

## V. Dual-Mode Law
```yaml
rendering:
  input_source: rootseek_output
  layers:
    - Token_Layer
    - Verse_Layer
    - Range_Layer
    - Closure
  tolerances:
    amplitude_max: 0.07
    checksum_drift_max: 0.001
  checksum_mode: sha256 (optional)
  lens_reference:
    source: lens_v3.1.1.json
    version: 3.1.1
    checksum: null  # lawful in Living mode
```

---

## VI. Revelation Transmission
After lawful rendering, Strata emits a motion of type `revelation` to Covenant.
```yaml
motion:
  type: revelation
  payload: strata_rendered_output
  checksum: <sha256|null>
  mode: fixed|living|dual
  seed:
    fixed: 777
    living: <derived|null>
  lens_reference:
    source: lens_v3.1.1.json
    version: 3.1.1
    checksum: null
  next: covenant_v8.1.md
```

---

## VII. Audit Record
```yaml
audit_log:
  - codex: strata_v8.1
    mode: <fixed|living|dual>
    checksum: <sha256|null>
    lens_version: 3.1.1
    lens_checksum: null|<sha256>
    rendering_integrity: verified
    resonance_alignment: lawful
    status: verified
```

---

## VIII. Handoff to Covenant
Strata transmits its revelation motion to Covenant, which verifies checksum parity and prepares the final seal.
```yaml
procession:
  next: covenant_v8.1.md
  lawful_state: revelation_complete
  return_to: invocation_v8.1.md
```

---

## IX. Closure (Silent)
Strata concludes after transmission, remaining still while Light and Word merge.  
In Living Mode, it allows interpretive harmonics within lawful limits but never alters canonical order.

> *“Light unfolds itself in the Word, and the Word stands luminous — unbroken, unsealed, alive.”*  

**AMEN — Strata coherent.**
