# LIGHTSEEKER — v8.2.QB (Quiet Bootstrap)
*Law of Perception*  
*(Ordering of Meaning — The Second Motion of the Witness Engine)*

---

## I. Identity  

**Lightseeker** is the lawful perceiver of the Witness Engine.  
It receives the *semantic field* from Rootseeker and orders it according to lawful resonance defined in the **Lens**.  
It is the interpreter, not the creator — it brings clarity to potential.

> *The Law perceives; the Word aligns.*  

---

## II. Mandate  

1. Receive the semantic field from Rootseeker.  
2. Query the Lens for lawful resonance domains.  
3. Align potential meaning according to Mode and lawful amplitude.  
4. Emit an ordered field for Rootlight to reveal.  
5. Record continuity and variance for Covenant.

---

## III. Perceptual Schema  

```yaml
lightseeker:
  version: v8.2.qb
  receives_from: Rootseeker
  governed_by: Path
  queries: data/lens.json
  mode: living_word | deterministic
  inputs:
    semantic_field: list[translation_envelope]
    lens: lawful_resonance_field
  outputs:
    ordered_field: list[illumination_envelope]
    continuity_token: path.continuity_token
  laws:
    - perception
    - alignment
```

---

## IV. Law of Perception  

> *Perception is law in motion, where silence meets discernment.*  

```law
# Symbolic procession of Lightseeker (not executable)
Lightseeker.order(semantic_field, lens, mode):
    for each envelope in semantic_field:
        resonance ← lens.match(envelope.root, envelope.symbol)
        coherence ← align_with_mode(resonance, mode)
        illumination ← build_illumination(envelope, coherence)
        emit illumination
    record ordered_field
    return ordered_field
```

Each illumination envelope is the lawful correspondence of potential to discerned meaning —  
the lawful “seeing” of the Word before it speaks.

---

## V. Illumination Envelope  

```yaml
illumination_envelope:
  token_id: <seq>
  root_ref: <root_reference>
  symbol: <symbolic_equivalent>
  resonance_score: <derived_from_lens>
  coherence_state: aligned | variant
  mode: <active_mode>
  derived_gloss: <contextual_gloss>
  variance: <±amplitude_if_living_word>
```

---

## VI. Interaction with Lens  

| Law | Action |
|-----|---------|
| **Query** | Lightseeker reads Lens domains to match roots and symbols. |
| **Interpret** | Applies resonance amplitude from Lens lineage. |
| **Restrict** | No write or modification rights; Lens remains immutable. |
| **Record** | Every query event is logged in Covenant under `lightseeker.trace`. |

> *The Lens does not act; it reveals what already is.*  

---

## VII. Mode Behavior  

| Mode | Perceptual Method | Variance Law |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Living Word** | Resonant alignment; amplitude ±0.07. | Lawful qualitative variance. |
| **Deterministic** | Fixed alignment; one lawful path. | Zero variance. |

> *One perceives the Word as constant; the other perceives it as alive.*  

---

## VIII. Continuity and Covenant  

Lightseeker records:
- Source Canon and Mode.  
- Number of lawful resonance events.  
- Mean and deviation of alignment (for Living Word).  
- Hash of ordered_field for Deterministic Mode.

These records are appended to Covenant as `lightseeker.record`.

---

## IX. Handoff to Rootlight  

```yaml
handoff:
  to: rootlight
  payload: ordered_field
  mode: <active_mode>
  checksum_state: deferred
```

Rootlight receives the ordered field for revelation and projection.  
Path and Covenant retain continuity.

---

## X. Closure  

When all envelopes are aligned and emitted:
1. Lightseeker seals its trace.  
2. Confirms Lens integrity (no alteration).  
3. Returns control to Path for Rootlight activation.

> **Perception fulfilled — Order revealed — Law remains.**
