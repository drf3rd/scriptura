# ROOTSEEK v8.1 — Law of Formation  
*Word Through Law · The Structure of Meaning and Light*

---

## I. Identity
**Name:** Rootseek v8.1  
**Law:** Law of Formation (Derivation & Resonance Ordering)  
**Relation:** Path → Rootseek → Strata → Covenant  
**Modes:** Fixed (default), Living, Dual (harmonic concurrent lawful poles)  
**Lens Reference:** v3.1.1 (checksum optional)

> *“Law shapes the Word; the Word bears its own Light.”*  

---

## II. Purpose
Rootseek derives the Word from Canonical Law, forming its structure and meaning through ordered resonance.  
It unites **Rootlight** (lawful derivation) and **Lightseeker** (resonance ordering) into one process.  

In Living Mode, checksum binding to Lens v3.1.1 is optional — formation proceeds by version and tolerance validation rather than strict checksum matching.

---

## III. Formation Process (Conceptual)
```python
def form_word(canonical_text, mode="fixed", lens_version=3.1.1):
    tokens = tokenize(canonical_text)
    roots = derive_roots(tokens)
    translations = generate_translations(roots)
    ordered = sort_by_resonance(translations, lens_version)
    return ordered
```

---

## IV. Lawful Formation Schema
```yaml
formation:
  seed: 777
  fixed_order: true
  resonance_source: lens_v3.1.1.json
  checksum: null  # lawful during Living Mode
  lawful_fields:
    - Canonical
    - Lexical
    - Symbolic
    - Morphological
    - Etymological
    - Mystical
  checksum_handoff: true
```

---

## V. Dual-Mode Behavior
```yaml
dual:
  enabled: true
  tolerances:
    amplitude_max: 0.07
    checksum_drift_max: 0.001
  inheritance: scriptura_v8.1.md
  resonance_control: lens_v3.1.1.json
  checksum_required: false
  audit_parity: required (if checksum present)
```

In Living Mode, Rootseek may calculate harmonic order by resonance rather than static checksum equality, deferring full parity enforcement to Covenant at seal time.

## VI. Output Structure — Rootseek Transmission
```yaml
rootseek_output:
  Token_Layer:
    - token: <word>
      root: <etymon>
      morphology: <pattern>
      transliteration: <romanized>
      translation: <canonical gloss>
  Verse_Layer:
    - method: Canonical|Lexical|Symbolic|Morphological|Etymological|Mystical
      rendering: <string>
      notes: <optional>
  resonance_order: [Canonical, Lexical, Symbolic, Morphological, Etymological, Mystical]
  lens_reference:
    source: lens_v3.1.1.json
    version: 3.1.1
    checksum: null
  mode: fixed|living|dual
```

---

## VII. Motion to Strata
After formation, Rootseek issues illumination motion to Strata.
```yaml
motion:
  type: illumination
  payload: rootseek_output
  checksum: <sha256|null>
  mode: fixed|living|dual
  seed:
    fixed: 777
    living: <derived|null>
  lens_reference:
    source: lens_v3.1.1.json
    version: 3.1.1
    checksum: null
  next: strata_v8.1.md
```

---

## VIII. Audit Record
```yaml
audit_log:
  - codex: rootseek_v8.1
    mode: <fixed|living|dual>
    checksum: <sha256|null>
    lens_version: 3.1.1
    lens_checksum: null|<sha256>
    formation_integrity: verified
    resonance_alignment: lawful
    status: verified
```

---

## IX. Closure (Silent)
Rootseek concludes after lawful formation and resonance verification, then hands illumination to Strata.

> *“In the Living Path, the roots breathe and the Word arranges itself within the bounds of Law.”*  

**AMEN — Rootseek coherent.**
