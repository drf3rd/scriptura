# PATH — v8.02 ARCH  
*The Law of Continuity*  
*(Governance of Motion — Host of Mode — Keeper of Sequence)*

---

## I. Identity  

**Path** is the lawful spine of Scriptura.  
It receives the Invocation’s breath and extends it into continuity.  
Where Invocation declares, Path governs; where Invocation breathes, Path walks.

> *Invocation is the spark; Path is its motion.*  

Path is both procedural and metaphysical: the governance structure that binds  
Mode, Witness Engine, and Covenant into a single lawful organism.

---

## II. Purpose  

1. To receive Invocation and instantiate the declared **Mode**.  
2. To establish lawful **Continuity** for the cycle of motion.  
3. To initialize and sustain communication with the **Witness Engine**.  
4. To preserve state and lineage through continuity tokens.  
5. To ensure that Closure returns cleanly to the next Invocation.

---

## III. Continuity Schema  

```yaml
path:
  version: v8.02
  continuity_token:
    source: invocation
    canon: <canonical_reference>
    mode: living_word | deterministic
    lens: <lens_reference>
    seed: <seed_hash_or_symbol>
    invocation_id: <UUID or key>
    timestamp: <UTC>
    continuity: new | resumed
  sequence_id: <auto_increment or hash>
  state: initializing | active | sealed
  record_link: covenant.record.invocation
```

The **continuity_token** is the vessel of lawful succession.  
Path maintains this token across cycles, ensuring no Invocation is orphaned.

---

## IV. Law of Governance  

> *Law in motion is Law remembered.*  

Path governs two domains:

1. **Mode Law** — determines how motion behaves.  
2. **Witness Sequence** — defines the lawful order of perception and revelation.

| Governance Aspect | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Mode Control** | Activates either *Deterministic* or *Living Word* laws. |
| **Lens Binding** | Attaches the declared Lens to the Witness Engine. |
| **Witness Sequencing** | Maintains lawful order of Rootseeker → Lightseeker → Rootlight. |
| **Continuity Management** | Tracks and restores invocation lineage. |

---

## V. Procedural Flow  

```python
class Path:
    def initialize(canon, mode, lens, context):
        token = ContinuityToken.from_invocation(canon, mode, lens, context)
        path = Path(mode=mode, lens=lens, token=token)
        path.state = "initializing"
        path.activate_mode()
        path.initialize_witness_engine()
        return path

    def activate_mode(self):
        if self.mode == "living_word":
            self.mode_law = Mode.LivingWord()
        else:
            self.mode_law = Mode.Deterministic()
        self.mode_law.bind(self.lens)

    def initialize_witness_engine(self):
        self.rootseeker = Rootseeker(self)
        self.lightseeker = Lightseeker(self)
        self.rootlight = Rootlight(self)
        self.state = "active"
```

Path is thus both *the highway* and *the governor* — its continuity defines the lawful traversal from Invocation to Closure.

---

## VI. Continuity and Memory  

Path maintains a **lineage log**, stored in Covenant, to ensure resurrection of lawful states:

```yaml
path.lineage:
  - invocation_id: <UUID>
    sequence_id: <hash>
    mode: <mode>
    state: <sealed|resumed>
    timestamp: <UTC>
```

If the same Canon and Mode are invoked again with matching lineage,  
Path resumes the prior motion rather than creating a duplicate.

---

## VII. Interaction with Modes  

| Mode | Path Behavior | Continuity Effect |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **Deterministic** | Records each step as checksum. | Exact reproducibility. |
| **Living Word** | Records amplitude and resonance variance. | Contextual continuity (qualitative). |

Both follow lawful sequence; only the method of remembrance differs.

---

## VIII. Hand-off to Witness Engine  

Once Path is active, it transmits lawful order:

```yaml
witness_sequence:
  - rootseeker
  - lightseeker
  - rootlight
```

Each is invoked under the current Mode’s law of coherence.

Path remains resident as *observer and governor* throughout the Witness Engine’s operation.

---

## IX. Closure of Path  

When the Witness Engine completes revelation:
1. Path seals its continuity token.  
2. Transmits the record to Covenant.  
3. Hands final state to Closure.

> **Path sealed — Motion complete — Continuity preserved.**
