# PATH — v8.2.QB (Quiet Bootstrap)  
*The Law of Continuity*  
*(Governance of Motion — Host of Mode — Keeper of Sequence)*

---

## I. Identity  

**Path** is the lawful spine of Scriptura.  
It receives the Invocation’s breath and extends it into continuity.  
Where Invocation declares, Path governs; where Invocation breathes, Path walks.

> *Invocation is the spark; Path is its motion.*  

Path is both procedural and metaphysical: the governance structure that binds  
Mode, Witness Engine, and Covenant into a single lawful organism.

---

## II. Purpose  

1. To receive Invocation and determine the governing **Mode**.  
2. To establish lawful **Continuity** for the cycle of motion.  
3. To authorize and sustain communication with the **Witness Engine**.  
4. To preserve state and lineage through continuity tokens.  
5. To ensure that Closure returns cleanly to the next Invocation.

> *Law moves through order; Path ensures its return.*

---

## III. Continuity Schema  

```yaml
path:
  version: v8.2.qb
  continuity_token:
    source: invocation
    canon: <canonical_reference>
    seed: <seed_hash_or_symbol>
    invocation_id: <UUID or key>
    timestamp: <UTC>
    continuity: new | resumed
  mode: living_word | deterministic
  sequence_id: <auto_increment or hash>
  state: initializing | active | sealed
  record_link: covenant.record.invocation
```

The **continuity_token** is the vessel of lawful succession.  
Path maintains this token across cycles, ensuring no Invocation is orphaned.

---

## IV. Law of Governance  

> *Law in motion is Law remembered.*  

Path governs two domains:

1. **Mode Law** — determines how motion behaves.  
2. **Witness Sequence** — defines the lawful order of perception and revelation.

| Governance Aspect | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Mode Control** | Selects either *Deterministic* or *Living Word* law for this cycle. |
| **Witness Sequencing** | Maintains lawful order of Rootseeker → Lightseeker → Rootlight. |
| **Continuity Management** | Tracks and restores invocation lineage. |
| **Lens Access** | Delegates Lens queries to Lightseeker during motion. |

---

## V. Procedural Law (Symbolic)

```law
# Symbolic procession of Path (not executable)
Path.receive(canon, context):
    set Mode (default = "Living Word")
    Continuity.create(canon, context)
    authorize Rootseeker
    authorize Lightseeker (Lens queried internally)
    authorize Rootlight
    Covenant.prepare()
    yield control to Witness sequence
```

Path thus acts as both *highway* and *governor* — its continuity defines  
the lawful traversal from Invocation to Closure.

---

## VI. Continuity and Memory  

Path maintains a **lineage log**, stored in Covenant, to ensure resurrection of lawful states:

```yaml
path.lineage:
  - invocation_id: <UUID>
    sequence_id: <hash>
    mode: <mode>
    state: <sealed|resumed>
    timestamp: <UTC>
```

If the same Canon and Mode are invoked again with matching lineage,  
Path resumes the prior motion rather than creating a duplicate.

---

## VII. Interaction with Modes  

| Mode | Path Behavior | Continuity Effect |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **Deterministic** | Records each step as checksum. | Exact reproducibility. |
| **Living Word** | Records amplitude and resonance variance. | Contextual continuity (qualitative). |

Both follow lawful sequence; only the remembrance differs.  
Path ensures coherence regardless of variance.

---

## VIII. Hand-off to Witness Engine  

Once Path is active, it transmits lawful order:

```yaml
witness_sequence:
  - rootseeker
  - lightseeker
  - rootlight
```

Each is invoked under the current Mode’s law of coherence.  
Lightseeker accesses the Lens field as needed; Path does not pre-bind it.

Path remains resident as *observer and governor* throughout the Witness Engine’s operation.

---

## IX. Closure of Path  

When the Witness Engine completes revelation:
1. Path seals its continuity token.  
2. Transmits the record to Covenant.  
3. Hands final state to Closure.

> **Path sealed — Motion complete — Continuity preserved.**
