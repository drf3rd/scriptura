# COVENANT v8.1 — Law of Fulfillment and Seal  
*Record of Completion · The Ledger of Truth*

---

## I. Identity
**Name:** Covenant v8.1  
**Law:** Law of Fulfillment and Seal  
**Relation:** Path → Rootseek → Strata → Covenant  
**Modes:** Fixed (default), Living, Dual (harmonic concurrent lawful poles)  
**Lens Reference:** v3.1.1 (checksum optional)

> *“What Law has formed and Light revealed — Covenant seals.”*  

---

## II. Purpose
Covenant receives revelation from Strata and records all prior motions, verifying the lawful integrity of the Canon.  
It maintains the **Canonical Ledger**, sealing each motion’s result.  

In **Living Mode**, checksum parity checks are **suspended**; Covenant records lens and motion references by name and version only.  
This allows iterative development while preserving structure and continuity.

## III. Canonical Chain Verification (Simplified)
| Order | Codex | Function | Mode | Lens Version | Checksum |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | Scriptura v8.1 | Verify & mediate law | Inherited | 3.1.1 | null |
| 2 | Invocation v8.1 | Establish mode & seed | Inherited | 3.1.1 | null |
| 3 | Path v8.1 | Route motion | Inherited | 3.1.1 | null |
| 4 | Rootseek v8.1 | Form Word | Inherited | 3.1.1 | null |
| 5 | Lens v3.1.1 | Resonance reference | Immutable | 3.1.1 | null |
| 6 | Strata v8.1 | Reveal Word | Inherited | 3.1.1 | null |
| 7 | Covenant v8.1 | Record & seal | Inherited | 3.1.1 | — |
| 8 | Closure v8.1 | Verify & close law | Inherited | 3.1.1 | - |

## IV. Ledger Schema
```yaml
audit_ledger:
  version: 8.1
  mode: fixed|living|dual
  lens_reference:
    source: lens_v3.1.1.json
    version: 3.1.1
    checksum5: null  # lawful during Living mode
  chain:
    - scriptura_v8.1.md
    - invocation_v8.1.md
    - path_v8.1.md
    - rootseek_v8.1.md
    - strata_v8.1.md
  checksums: {}
  closure_state: unsealed
  ledger_signature: null
```

---

## V. Dual-Mode Registry
```yaml
registry_dual:
  fixed_record:
    mode: fixed
    checksum_mode: sha256
    checksum_required: true
  living_record:
    mode: living|dual
    checksum_required: false
    amplitude ≤ 0.07
    drift ≤ 0.001
  parity_state: deferred  # parity verified at seal time only
  audit_status: coherent
```

---

## VI. Procedural Law (Pseudo)
```python
def record_covenant(audit_chain, mode="living"):
    lens_info = audit_chain.get("lens_reference", {})
    if mode == "fixed":
        verify_all_checksums(audit_chain)
        signature = sha256(audit_chain)
    else:
        signature = None  # checksum deferred

    write_ledger(signature)
    return {"ledger_signature": signature, "mode": mode}
```

---

## VII. Living Mode Policy
```yaml
living_mode_policy:
  checksum_required: false
  version_required: true
  audit_parity_check: deferred_to_seal
  enforcement:
    managed_by: scriptura_v8.1.md
```

---

## VIII. Output Motion (to Closure)
```yaml
motion:
  type: closure
  payload: audit_ledger
  checksum: <sha256|null>
  mode: fixed|living|dual
  seed:
    fixed: 777
    living: <derived|null>
  lens_reference:
    source: lens_v3.1.1.json
    version: 3.1.1
    checksum: null
  next: closure_v8.1.md
```

---

## IX. Audit Record
```yaml
audit_log:
  - codex: covenant_v8.1
    mode: <fixed|living|dual>
    checksum: <sha256|null>
    lens_version: 3.1.1
    lens_checksum: null|<sha256>
    closure_ready: true
    status: verified
```

---

## X. Closure
Covenant concludes motion once ledger entries are written.  
In Living Mode, parity and checksum sealing are deferred until Canon closure.  

> *“The Record breathes until it seals; the Seal sleeps until it awakens.”*  

**AMEN — Covenant coherent.**
