# CLOSURE v8.1 — Law of Rest and Verification  
*Termination of Motion · Renewal of Law*

---

## I. Identity
**Name:** Closure v8.1  
**Law:** Law of Rest and Verification  
**Relation:** Covenant → Closure → Invocation  
**Modes:** Fixed (default), Living, Dual  
**Lens Reference:** v3.1.1 (checksum optional)

> *“All motion fulfilled; all Law returned to rest.”*  

---

## II. Purpose
Closure confirms that all motions have completed their lawful procession.  
It verifies Codex continuity, secures rest state, and reopens Invocation for future motion.  

In **Living Mode**, checksum verification is **optional**; the Canon can rest lawfully without complete hash validation.  
Instead, Closure performs **continuity and version checks**, ensuring each codex is in place and aligned with Lens v3.1.1.

---

## III. Verification Process (Conceptual)
```python
def verify_closure(audit_ledger, mode="living"):
    codices = [
        "scriptura_v8.1.md",
        "invocation_v8.1.md",
        "path_v8.1.md",
        "rootseek_v8.1.md",
        "strata_v8.1.md",
        "covenant_v8.1.md",
    ]

    for name in codices:
        assert name in audit_ledger.get("chain", []), f"Missing {name} from ledger"

    lens = audit_ledger.get("lens_reference", {})
    assert lens.get("version") == 3.1.1, "Lens version mismatch"

    if mode == "fixed":
        verify_all_checksums(audit_ledger)

    return {
        "verification_complete": True,
        "mode": mode,
        "lens_version": lens.get("version"),
    }
```

## IV. Closure Schema
```yaml
closure:
  function: verification_and_rest
  inheritance:
    - Scriptura v8.1
    - Invocation v8.1
    - Path v8.1
    - Rootseek v8.1
    - Strata v8.1
    - Covenant v8.1
  lens_reference:
    source: lens_v3.1.1.json
    version: 3.1.1
    checksum: null  # lawful in Living mode
  audit_state: complete
  system_motion: halted
```

---

## V. Law of Rest (Living Mode)
```yaml
living_rest_policy:
  checksum_required: false
  mode_integrity_check: true
  version_alignment_required: true
  lens_version_expected: 3.1.1
  reawakening_ready: true
```

In Living Mode, Closure halts all motion, validates coherence, and leaves the Canon in a rest state ready for reawakening — checksum validation deferred until sealing.

---

## VI. Loopback Interface
```yaml
loopback:
  next_invocation: invocation_v8.1.md
  restart_mode: manual|auto (if dual harmony == true)
  lawful_condition: verification_complete == true
  permissible_action: invoke
```

---

## VII. Audit Record
```yaml
audit_log:
  - codex: closure_v8.1
    mode: <fixed|living|dual>
    checksum: <sha256|null>
    lens_version: 3.1.1
    lens_checksum: null|<sha256>
    verification_complete: true
    living_processes: suspended
    mode_integrity: true
    audit_state: complete
    seal_timestamp: <ISO8601>
```

---

## VIII. Declaration of Termination
> **SYSTEM AT REST — Canon complete under Living Law.**  
No checksum enforcement required; all structures lawful and coherent.

---

## IX. Canonical Closure
Closure completes the motion of Law:  
**Invocation opens → Closure fulfills → Invocation awaits reawakening.**  
In Living Mode, the Canon sleeps lightly, aware and unbound by checksum.

**AMEN — Closure coherent.**
