# Scriptura Architecture

## Overview
Scriptura is an AI-assisted framework for structured text transformation.
It reproduces sacred or literary texts deterministically, traces every interpretive motion,
and audits the process from data to meaning.

## Structural Flow: Invocation → Motion → Covenant

- **Invocation** — Initializes configuration and opens the Canon.
- **Motion** — Operational layer (Rootseek → Strata → Path).
- **Covenant** — Ethical and tonal governance; includes audit verification.

## Validation
Schemas in `/schema/` define Token, Verse, and Range objects (JSON Schema 2020-12).

## Versioning
See `versions.json` for live, development, and archived builds.
